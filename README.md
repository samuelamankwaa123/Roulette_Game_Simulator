Objectives

This project is designed to:

Simulate the probability and randomness of Roulette outcomes.
Demonstrate the impact of different betting strategies.
Provide insights into the mathematical foundation of casino games, including house edges and payouts.
How It Works
Players begin by choosing their preferred bet type, entering their wager, and placing their bets. The simulated wheel then spins to generate a random outcome, which is matched against the playerâ€™s bet. The game provides immediate feedback, indicating whether the bet was successful and the amount won or lost.

Payout Structure
Single Number Bets: High risk, high reward with the highest payouts.
Grouped Bets (e.g., Red/Black, Odd/Even): Lower risk and consistent payouts.
Range Bets (Dozens and Columns): Medium risk with moderate rewards.

Educational Value
Probability & Statistics: Understand the randomness and likelihood of different outcomes.
Game Theory: Explore how betting strategies can influence results.
Casino Mechanics: Learn about the balance between player payouts and the house edge.
Target Audience
This simulation is ideal for:

Mathematics and statistics enthusiasts curious about probability in games.
Game developers looking to understand Roulette mechanics.
Casino game players seeking to explore strategies in a risk-free environment.
Future Enhancements
